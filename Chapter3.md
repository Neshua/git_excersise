Little frog in a big pond - this is bigger than frogs

Howard and Jacque walk along the 5th arondissement. 
Jacque lit his cigarette, took a deep breath and as he exhaled a cloud of smoke said "I haven't heard from Anissa in over 3 months".
"Who's Anissa?"
"We worked together on a mission in Quebec 15 years ago. She's the smartest frog I know."
Jacque looked disturbed. 
"Do you think she's gone?" said Howard solemnly.
"She's never missed our monthly check-ins. I've been doing my own investigation to try to reach her. No one's seen her for a very a long time. TRhis is bigger than Paris."
