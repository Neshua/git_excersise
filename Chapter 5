The Electric Toadstool

Beads of sweat rolled down Montclair stared at his amphibious companion.

Once a nuisance, then a friend, a lover, even, and now? A dark realization rose in his chest heart.


"Salamander. Howard. It can't be you! All those late nights walking by the canal.

The softness in your beady frog eyes when I told you how I felt about you. About us.

It can't be a ruse. You can't be the villain!"

"But I am. Ribbit."

The authorities sentenced Howard to the electric chair, but he was too small, so they put him on a normal stove instead.

As his skin shriveled and his blood bubbled, Montclair knew: The last frog died a coward and a criminal.
